# Queueify UI

To run the project please use the LTS version of nodejs.

- install dependencies with `npm install`
- run the server with `npm run`

It runs when both the server and the client are running on localhost as
for now it has no configuration files nor environment variables to specify
external API host.

Services were build using inversify for dependency injection using
inversify-react, thats why there are no functional components,
even though i like them a lot.

Dockerized build and image can be done if you ask me to do so :).
